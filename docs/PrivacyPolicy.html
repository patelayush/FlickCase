    <h1>Privacy Policy for FlickCase</h1>
    <p>Last updated: May 10, 2025</p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how FlickCase collects, uses, and shares information when you use our mobile application (the "App"). By using the App, you consent to the data practices described in this policy.</p>

    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>FlickCase does not directly collect any personally identifiable information from you, such as your name, email address, phone number, or location. The App primarily displays information about movies and TV shows obtained from the TMDb API.</p>

    <p>However, please be aware that third-party services integrated within the App, such as analytics tools or advertising networks (if implemented in the future), may collect information about your usage of the App. This Privacy Policy does not cover the practices of these third-party services. We encourage you to review their respective privacy policies.</p>

    <h2>3. How We Use Information</h2>
    <p>As FlickCase does not directly collect personal information, we do not use your personal data for any specific purposes. The App's functionality is solely based on displaying publicly available information from the TMDb API.</p>

    <p>If third-party services collect usage data, this information may be used for purposes such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Analyzing App usage and performance.</li>
        <li>Providing and improving the App's features.</li>
        <li>Serving targeted advertisements (if the App includes ads in the future).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Sharing of Information</h2>
    <p>FlickCase does not share any personally identifiable information with third parties because we do not collect it. Any data collected by integrated third-party services is governed by their own privacy policies.</p>

    <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>As FlickCase does not directly collect personal information, we do not retain any of your personal data.</p>

    <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>FlickCase is a general audience app and does not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us so that we can take appropriate action.</p>

    <h2>7. Security</h2>
    <p>While FlickCase itself does not store personal information, we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect any data handled within the App. However, please remember that no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

    <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.</p>

    <h2>9. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at: <a href="mailto:ayushpatel95@gmail.com">ayushpatel95@gmail.com</a></p>
